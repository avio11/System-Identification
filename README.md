# System-Identification
Machine learning techniques for linear and nonlinear system identification.

Implemented thus far:

1) ARX model (Linear model)
  - Batch Least Squares
  - Gradient Descent
  - Ridge regression
  - LASSO Coordinate Descent
  
2) NARX model (Nonlinear model)
  - Batch Least Squares
  - Ridge Regression

3) Neural Networks 
  - Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (Training implemented by Error Backpropagation)

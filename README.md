# System-Identification
Machine learning techniques for linear and nonlinear system identification.

Implemented thus far:

1) ARX model
  - Batch Least Squares
  - Gradient Descent
  - Ridge regression
  - LASSO Coordinate Descent
  
2) NARX model

3) Neural Networks
  - Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (Error Backpropagation)
